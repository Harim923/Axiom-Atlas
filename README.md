## 🔍 About

**Axiom-Atlas** is an open-source initiative to structurally organize mathematical theorems based on the **axioms used in their proofs**.

This repository implements the system proposed in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00063) (*Atlas: Polynomial Embedding of Mathematical Proofs via Axiom Tracking*), which introduces a framework for encoding the structure of proofs as vectors over an axiom space. 

The core idea:  
> Just as geography maps terrains, we can map mathematics using its most fundamental building blocks — axioms.

## 🧠 Vision

Mathematical proofs are not isolated results. They are chains of reasoning built on foundational truths.  
By tracking and embedding axioms, **we can quantify, compare, and visualize proofs in entirely new ways.**

- Understand **the structure of proofs**
- Visualize **the meta-structure of axiom systems**
- Reveal **similarities between theorems** based on foundational patterns
- Enable automated reasoning and clustering

## 🚀 What's Coming Next?

The follow-up system, **ProofGPT**, will extend this work by enabling:

- **Proof synthesis** using the embedded axiom structure
- **Theorem vectorization** for neural comparison
- **Cross-foundation translation**, suggesting alternate proof strategies across axiom systems

Stay tuned — ProofGPT will use Axiom-Atlas as its knowledge backbone.
